Need an "undo" function in pybook for in case when pybook succeeds but later processes in crypt machine fails

Need unit test for partial fill ( for multiple orders in level) 

Cryptmachine - We need submit order because it can turn into take or craeate
    current way of convertin from price/qty input to buying qty/selling qty is retarded.
    We can use consistent price/qty notation for submit order .. create_quote and take_quote    
    needs to be converted to price/qty notation.

Need to sort levels by timestamp, so priority will be given to earlier orders, AS OF NOW TIME PRIORITY
IS NOT CONSIDERED !!! 
    - need to convert level dict to level linked list 
   

When submitting, need to take into consideration when some parts fill as take quotes 
but need to make create quote too if there is not enough to take 

Should we take into account cases where partial fills are not allowed?

Implement options unimplemneted in pybook



WORKSPACE-----------------------------------

Crypto buying LTC
crypto buying qty 100 
Crypto selling BTC
crypto selling qty 50
selling 50 btc for 2 ltc each 
or buying 100 ltc for .5 btc each

in the book LTC intrument BTC unit

price per unit 1/2 (50/100) 
qty 100 (if ask this is quantity selling , if bid this is quantiy buying)
ask/bid - bid (bidding for LTC)

Crypto buying BTC
crypto buying qty 100 
Crypto selling LTC
crypto selling qty 50
Selling 50 LTC for 100 BTC
or selling 50 ltc at .5 btc each


in the book LTC intrument BTC unit

price per unit 1/2 (50/100) LTC price per BTC 
    (5000 satoshi lite / 1000 satoshi) *( 1 LTC / 10 satoshi lite) * (10 satoshi / 1 BTC)  
qty 50 (if ask this is quantity selling , if bid this is quantiy buying)
ask/bid - ask (asking for LTC)



so 

ask if crypto_buying == unit and crypto_selling == instrument

bid if crypto_buying == instrument and cyrpto_selling == unit

qty  = crytpo_buying if ask, crypto_selling if bid

price = crypt_selling_qty/ crypto_buying_qty if ask crypto_buying_qty / crypto_selling_qty if bid
